<h2><b> Electric Potential </h2> </b>
<p> When a small positive test charge is placed in the elactric field  due to another charge,it experiences a force.So,work has to bo done on the positive test charge to move it against this force of repulsion. <b>The electric potential(or potential) at a point in an electric field is defined as the work done in moving a unit positive charge from infinity to that point. </b> Potential is denoted by the symbol V and its unit is volt. A potential of 1 volt at a point means that 1 joule of work is done in moving 1 unit positive charge from infinity to that point.Since the unit of charge is coulumb,so we can say that: A potential of 1 volt at a point means that 1 joule  of work is done in moving 1 coulomb of positive charge from infinity to that point.A more common term used in electricity is,however,potential difference which we will discuss now.
<h3><b> Potential Difference </h3> </b>
<p> The <i> difference in electric potential between two points is known as potential difference. </i> <b> The potential difference between two points in an electric circuit is defined as the amount of work done in moving a unit charge from one point to the other point. </b>
<br> That is: 
<p style="text-align:center;">Potential difference = work done/Quantity of charge moved </p>
